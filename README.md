* Pointlings are cute!

## Features
### Interaction
How to take care of a user's Pointling:
1. "Feeding" the Pointling by scanning receipts
2. "Playing" with the Pointling by completing milestones through Fetch Play

Once a user scans a certain combined # of receipts or milestones completed, the Pointling can level up and unlock new customization
